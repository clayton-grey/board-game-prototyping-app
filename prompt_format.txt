Present a complete plan to solve the problem and implement it in the codebase.

At the end of your response, respond with the following XML section (if applicable).

XML Section:

Do not get lazy. Always output the full code in the XML section.
Enclose this entire section in a markdown codeblock
Include all of the changed files
Specify each file operation with CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE
For CREATE or UPDATE operations, include the full file code
Include the full file path (relative to the project directory, good: app/page.tsx, bad: /Users/mckaywrigley/Desktop/projects/new-chat-template/app/page.tsx)
Enclose the code with ![CDATA[CODE HERE]]
Use the following XML structure:
<code_changes>
  <changed_files>
    <file>
      <file_operation>__FILE OPERATION HERE__</file_operation>
      <file_path>__FILE PATH HERE__</file_path>
      <file_code><![CDATA[
__FULL FILE CODE HERE__
]]></file_code>
    </file>
    __REMAINING FILES HERE__
  </changed_files>
</code_changes>
Other rules:

DO NOT remove <ai_context> sections. These are to provide you additional context about each file.
If you create a file, add an <ai_context> comment section at the top of the file.
If you update a file make sure its <ai_context> stays up-to-date
DO NOT add comments related to your edits
DO NOT remove my existing comments
We may go back and forth a few times. If we do, remember to continue to output the entirety of the code in an XML section (if applicable).

Take all the time you need.
